Lecture 2:

    Describe a Unix command not discussed in the class or the book. Try to find something that might be useful. When would you use that command? nl is a command numbers lines of text in output. I tried it with ex: cat "filename.txt" | nl to get the text in that file numbered. it may be useful if you want to add that information to any file for human readability or distinguish line breaks in a weird esoteric way for some reason. 
    Describe a customization for the command you chose above (describe the effect of a flag/parameter). nl -v# "filename.txt" will start the line numbering at whatever number # was designated
    What flags will make the ls command write out the files sizes in “human-friendly” mode? ls -lh or -l -h
    What flag will make the rm command ask for permission when removing a file? rm -i
    Create a nested directory structure. Create files in various directories. 
    mkdir -p nesttest/nest2/nest3/nest4
    touch test.txt nest2/test2.txt nest2/nest3/test3.txt nest2/nest3/nest4/test4.txt
    List the absolute and relative path to a file.
    absolute: /home/rsv5094/bmmb852/nesttest/nest2/nest3/nest4/test4.txt
    relative from bmmb852: /nesttest/nest2/nest3/nest4/test4.txt
    Demonstrate path shortcuts using the home directory, current directory, and parent directory.
    home: ~
    current: .
    parent: ..
