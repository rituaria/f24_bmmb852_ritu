#Assignment Questions (commands for full process below)
Select an organism and download its corresponding GFF file. done

Investigate this file with command line UNIX tools. done

Find answers to the following questions:

    Tell us a bit about the organism. 
    Athene cunicularia is also known as the burrowing owl, taxon ID 194338. 
    Some information about the annotation built:
    $ cat Athene_cunicularia.athCun1.112.gff3 | grep '#' | grep -v '##'
        #!genome-build  athCun1
        #!genome-version athCun1
        #!genome-date 2018-06
        #!genome-build-accession GCA_003259725.1
        #!genebuild-last-updated 2019-09

    How many features does the file contain? 693945
    $ cat feature_types.txt | wc -l
        693945

    
    How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? 445
    $ cat Athene_cunicularia.athCun1.112.gff3 | grep '##s'| wc -l
        445


    How many genes are listed for this organism? 13835
    $ cat feature_types.txt | sort-uniq-count-rank
    #excerpt of output
        13835   gene
    #Incorrect way to answer this: cat feature_types.txt | grep 'gene' | wc -l, greps
    #Above counts features like "pseudogene" and "ncRNA_gene" as well which should not be included from a biological perspective


    What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
    $ cat feature_types.txt | sort-uniq-count-rank |head
        308274  exon
        299787  CDS
        22665   mRNA
        18929   biological_region
        14322   five_prime_UTR
        13835   gene
        13156   three_prime_UTR
        1153    ncRNA_gene
        921     lnc_RNA
        445     region

    Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?
I am unsure what makes a complete and well-annotated organism... There are tools like BUSCO and GenomeQC that can analyze an assembly quality in general or against a reference genome. From my reading this is annotated, sure, but I don't know if well enough to have robust results for further genomic analysis.

Share any other insights you might note.
Parsing files solely via the terminal or in an automated fashion requires a lot of care into how you grep the specific information you need. Example being the number of genes question, there may be instances where you want to include pseudogenes or figure out what a feature called noncoding RNA genes is. The question you are trying to answer needs to be clear and paired with an understanding that labels and categories are human imposed, biology is complex. It is helpful to understand the parameters and information provided in the file you are working with.

Create a text file that shows both how you downloaded the data and how you generated each of your results. done, see below

Commit the file to your GitHub repository that you created for this course.
